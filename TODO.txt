	can't fire while moving

projectile
	movement
		stationary
			snap
			hover
	trajectory
		sweeping
		spin - reimplement
	damage
		figure out
			buildup damage//how many hits before damage is applied? how much damage?
			stack damage//
				all require effect identity?

		implement
			slow effect//speed damage?
			blind effect//vision damage?
			headshot
			IAffectable Affectable AffectableWeakpoint
			emp
				increase next frame time?
			radar
				effect or AOE ?
				gradient ?
			damage
			rof reduction
			knockback can deflect projectile
				depends on size and velocity
				locked on can still dodge
			events
				if eternal
					create this
				else
					create parent

to theorize
	difference between weapon and subweapon
	weapon has recoil - subweapon could use some?
	subweapon has autoaim - could definitely work
		but what about angle limitation
			could work, but only if turret has real orientation
	subweapon fires automatically
		simple bool
	trajectory display
		can be expensive
		by default on turret deploy
	self
		speed modifier
		sight modifier
		heal / regen
		timer
	movements
		just because they can't be modelized with effects and projectile
			it doesn't mean they can't be modelized
		teleportation
			projectile
		dash
			???
		jump
			self knockback?
	
	shields
		knockback always on center of mass
		no freeze or blindness?
		
	maps
		tunnels
		every single doom maps?
		load any heightmap?
		2d?
	structure
		weapon
			shot
			resource
			recoil
			projectile
				trajectory
				effect

		weapon
			shot - type
				* self - applies effect
				* explosion - applies effect in range
				* gun - sends projectile to apply effect
			
			effect
			
			explosion (if type explosion)?
				duration
				range
			
			projectile (if type gun)
				subweapon

	projectile lifespan
		touch missile
			starts on fire
			dies on timeout

		turret
			start on timeout
			ends on
				activation time ?
				ammunition
				concurent turrets

		shield
			starts on fire
			dies on timeout
			
		splitter
			starts on timeout
			ends on timeout

		multi-splitter
			starts on timeout
			prolongates timeout?

			
		possible solutions
			timeout for everything
				+ simple
				- anything triggered on timeout can only work once
					no duration AOE or turrets
					
			duration for explosion, turrets and contact
				+ fits with explosion durations
				
				-+ projectile can continue beyond effect
					wave of fire becomes boring proj
					
				- effect can continue beyond projectile
					fire remains stuck to wall after shot
				
				- turret spawned at timeout is always stationary
				
				- turret spawned at trigger can be stationary
				
				fixing
					* some way to bind the death of the projectile
						and the end of the effect
		
		
goals
	artillery fight
		spotter/marker and shooter team
		coordinates
	cards become more powerful, allowing closer and closer customization

	Killing someone gives you lvls
	Getting a lvl gives everyone else upgrade points for their weapons
	lvls somehow help getting to boss?

controller
	fix jump
	add physics (knockback)
	
aesthetics
	speed of sound

	shockwave using normal
	custom line renderer
		affected by wind
		disapears from the middle
		better bounces
	explosion size
		sphereoverlap
		score using distance and size
		scale with score (sqrt likely)
		delete redundant explosions
			small, surrounded, close to others
		fuse two explosions with clear line of sight?
		volumetric explosion
