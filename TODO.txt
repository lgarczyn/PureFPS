	TODO SIMPLE
		implement subweapon lifetime/max number
		implement enemy player for murder
		create subweapon iterator and counter tools
			once done, remove empty lists
				is this needed ?
		cleanup omnisharp
	TODO COMPLEX
		damage over time
			effect that requires contact
			lifetime is the same, damage still spread over it
			use trigger collider to do it
			add effect and only use it if it's in contact?
				check by distance?
		swiping projectile
			range
			angle 0 is vertical
			angle and angle variation
			math?
			circular cast?
				take player movement in account?
			keep rotation away from player
			actual TODO
				weapon and subweapon spawning
					position
						should I use lifetime? it's convenient
						lifetime/speed = distance
						distance / range = angular lifetime?
						angular lifetime / 2 -> angular origin
						turn that into quaternion, and multiply by transform
						remultiply by range
						velocity is similar, but pi/2 off
						where does orbit angle fit?
						AAAAAAAAAAAARG
				projectile behaviour
					would kinda be easier with a damn joint
					so basically get the next position on its own, in the same way, except with a different lifetime
					since the logic is the same, a better
	should a shield appear at the end of a frame?
		any weapon should actually only fire at end of frame
			however Input has a potential lag of one frame
			shields can't be retroactively placed
		makes sense, since they can only work for future updates
	actual TODO
		projectile can activate and use a joint, and attach itself to player
			no need for hierarchy
			need to learn how to setup stuff
				need to rotate the plan axis quaternion
				need to set up original position
		information needed:
			center position, target transform, range, velocity, lifetime
				shit, range is different than lifetime
		remove work from weapon and subweapons
			precision could be handled by projectiles
	Time.time is undefined during awake, shit
		also, can I use Time.time in different scene?
		do I risk loosing precision?


	WHAT DO I NEED
		subframe logic
			raycast
				+get exact time
				=can spawn mid-frame, but arrival might be in different order
				-can't kill shield midframe without massive work
			Unity
				= may be able to deduce time
				+ can accelerate item one frame
				- can't kill shield midframe
			bullet
				+is able to deduce time
				+can accelerate items one frame
				+can kill shield midframe perfectly fine
					not exactly sure if it's a good idea
		advanced masks
			raycasts
				yikes
			Unity
				items have an ignore list, that can't be serialized
			Bullet
				advanced mask callbacks, varying solutions

bugs
	particles rotate when looked from above or underneath and the camera moves
		use new standard particle shader
	effect len probably doesn't happen for the first frame, and it isn't balanced next frame
		same for effects happening in the "past"
		add a spent-effect date, or reduce value and starting time
	sound is badly affected by rof
		sound doesn't go as low
		startfire isn't called again and can't update the rof
		should audioweapon do everithing?
	rof multiplier of 0 doesn't prevent firing last bullet

effects
	radar effect
		shader with high priority inside mesh and behind geometry (wow)
		one more thing that affectable will need to access to
	movement effect
		flying, swimming, etc
	invisibility
	graviy
	non-killing poison
	freeze
		affect rotation ?
	stochastic shader for terrain

optimization/refactoring
	modify effects to avoid constant sorting/filtering
	they are deleted and used by endtime mostly, so that should be the key
		maybe?
		a sorted queue of sorts would be best to avoid high-tech solutions

	trajectory
		Some trajectories can be implemented as projectiles
			orbit, slicing
		However, if we want more custom stuff, some will need to be implemented as animations ?
			at least, bound to a point on the character
			think lances, swords and knives
		sweeping
		spin - reimplement
			is there an actual tactical advantage to a spinning projectile ?
	shields
		basically large rigid bodies with affectable
	damage
		figure out
			buildup damage//how many hits before damage is applied? how much damage?
			unstackable damage//
				all require effect identity?

sniper missing zoom
shotgun v

to theorize
	difference between weapon and subweapon
		aiming controller
		activation
			trigger vs birth
		recoil
		
		fusing
			could allow taking control from drone
			weapon that triggers on death
			turret with recoil


		weapon has recoil - subweapon could use some?
		subweapon has autoaim - could definitely work
			but what about angle limitation
				could work, but only if turret has real orientation
		subweapon fires automatically
			ideally some weapon could be automatic
		trajectory display
			can be expensive
			by default on turret deploy / snap
	self
		speed modifier
		sight modifier
		heal / regen
		timer
	movements
		just because they can't be modelized with effects and projectile
			it doesn't mean they can't be modelized

	projectile lifespan
		touch missile
			starts on fire
			dies on timeout

		turret
			start on timeout
			ends on
				activation time ?
				ammunition
				concurent turrets

		shield
			starts on fire
			dies on timeout
			
		splitter
			starts on timeout
			ends on timeout

		multi-splitter
			starts on timeout
			prolongates timeout?

			
		possible solutions
			timeout for everything
				+ simple
				- anything triggered on timeout can only work once
					no duration AOE or turrets
					
			duration for explosion, turrets and contact
				+ fits with explosion durations
				
				-+ projectile can continue beyond effect
					wave of fire becomes boring proj
					
				- effect can continue beyond projectile
					fire remains stuck to wall after shot
				
				- turret spawned at timeout is always stationary
				
				- turret spawned at trigger can be stationary
				
				fixing
					* some way to bind the death of the projectile
						and the end of the effect
	weapon card
		weapon type + modifiers ?
	weapon modifiers
		positive
			friendly fire off
				heal allies
			aim (weapon only)
			positive effect
			resource boost
			allow 1-by-1 reload
			range/lifetime/etc.
			silent
			better damage against shields
			better damage against unshielded
			damage goes through shield
		negative
			worse against shields
			worse against no shields
			reload penalty
			cancel bonus

			knockback
			negative effect on self?
				damage, slowness, etc
		tradeoff
			heat-type ammo
				constant recharge, but less ammo and 0ammo penalty

			shotgun
			machinegun
